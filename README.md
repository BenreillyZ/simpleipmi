## Background:
Over the last decade, PC performance has improved significantly, making high-performance systems affordable for most users. However, regular home computer accessories still lack remote access features. This forces users to invest in expensive workstations or servers for these capabilities, which is unnecessary for most personal use cases.

The open-source community already has a solution called **PiKVM**, which replicates many functions of BMC/IPMI. However, PiKVM requires a Raspberry Pi, which isnâ€™t always practical for regular users. Software like **Microsoft Remote Desktop** is useful but limited to certain OS versions and doesnâ€™t fully cover our objectives.

This project aims to create a budget-friendly device for personal computers and small local servers that provides basic remote access without costly setups.

## Project Proposal:
Weâ€™re building a **low-cost remote management device** using basic components. The first version will focus on the ESP32 microcontroller for essential functions, with plans to add advanced features using ARM-based boards later.
